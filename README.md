# AdaptiveAgent

AdaptiveAgent is a Bun + TypeScript runtime for goal-oriented AI agents with typed tools, structured events, resumable runs, and bounded delegation to child runs.

This repository currently contains two things:

- living v1.4 product and contract docs
- a working `@adaptive-agent/core` prototype under `packages/core`

The docs describe the intended architecture across `@adaptive-agent/core`, `@adaptive-agent/store-postgres`, and `@adaptive-agent/dashboard-example`. The checked-in code today is focused on the core runtime and examples.

## Current Status

Implemented in the prototype today:

- `run()`, `interrupt()`, `resume()`, and `executePlan()` on the core agent
- typed tool registration and tool-call execution
- synthetic `delegate.*` tools backed by child runs
- in-memory run, event, snapshot, and plan stores for local development
- model adapters for Ollama, OpenRouter, and Mistral
- structured runtime logging with Pino
- skill loading from `SKILL.md` files and conversion into delegate profiles
- built-in file, shell, and web tools

Not implemented yet:

- `plan()` generation in the runtime scaffold
- the Postgres store package described in the contracts
- the dashboard example package described in the spec

## What The Core Package Does

`packages/core` is the executable heart of the repo. It exposes:

- `AdaptiveAgent`
- in-memory stores for runs, events, snapshots, and plans
- model adapters for Ollama, OpenRouter, and Mistral
- built-in tools including `read_file`, `list_directory`, `write_file`, `shell_exec`, `web_search`, and `read_web_page`
- skill parsing utilities that load `SKILL.md` files and turn them into delegate definitions
- structured logging helpers for model requests, tool calls, outputs, and delegation lifecycle events

The delegation model follows the v1.4 design boundary: tools remain the only first-class executable primitive, and delegation is represented as synthetic `delegate.<name>` tools plus normal child runs.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the sample agent with Ollama:

```bash
bun run examples/run-agent.ts
```

Run the sample with a custom goal:

```bash
bun run examples/run-agent.ts "Explain the architecture of this repository"
```

Use a hosted provider instead:

```bash
PROVIDER=openrouter OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... bun run examples/run-agent.ts
PROVIDER=mistral MISTRAL_API_KEY=... bun run examples/run-agent.ts
```

The sample script:

- builds a provider-specific model adapter
- registers built-in tools
- loads delegates from `examples/skills/`
- runs the agent against your goal
- prints the final result plus run and child-run activity

Additional setup details and environment variable notes live in `examples/README.md`.

## Minimal Repo-Local Example

This repository is a monorepo prototype rather than a published package, so local examples import from the workspace source directly:

```ts
import { AdaptiveAgent } from './packages/core/src/adaptive-agent.js';
import { InMemoryEventStore } from './packages/core/src/in-memory-event-store.js';
import { InMemoryRunStore } from './packages/core/src/in-memory-run-store.js';
import { InMemorySnapshotStore } from './packages/core/src/in-memory-snapshot-store.js';
import { createModelAdapter } from './packages/core/src/adapters/create-model-adapter.js';
import { createListDirectoryTool } from './packages/core/src/tools/list-directory.js';
import { createReadFileTool } from './packages/core/src/tools/read-file.js';

const projectRoot = process.cwd();

const agent = new AdaptiveAgent({
  model: createModelAdapter({
    provider: 'ollama',
    model: process.env.OLLAMA_MODEL ?? 'qwen3.5',
  }),
  tools: [
    createReadFileTool({ allowedRoot: projectRoot }),
    createListDirectoryTool({ allowedRoot: projectRoot }),
  ],
  runStore: new InMemoryRunStore(),
  eventStore: new InMemoryEventStore(),
  snapshotStore: new InMemorySnapshotStore(),
});

const result = await agent.run({
  goal: 'List the top-level files in this repository and summarize their purpose.',
});

console.log(result);
```

For a fuller example with delegates, approvals, provider selection, markdown rendering, and optional web tools, see `examples/run-agent.ts`.

## Skills And Delegation

The sample runtime can load skills from Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```text
examples/skills/
|- file-analyst/SKILL.md
`- researcher/SKILL.md
```

Each skill is parsed into a `SkillDefinition` and then converted into a delegate profile. At runtime, that profile is exposed to the model as a synthetic tool such as `delegate.file-analyst` or `delegate.researcher`.

This keeps delegation aligned with the core design:

- the planner still chooses tools
- child work happens in a separate run
- parent and child runs keep separate events and snapshots
- the parent resumes only after the child returns a structured result

## Built-In Tools

The prototype includes several built-in tools for local experiments:

- `read_file`
- `list_directory`
- `write_file`
- `shell_exec`
- `web_search`
- `read_web_page`

`write_file` and `shell_exec` require approval. The example script supports interactive approval and an `--auto-approve` mode for non-interactive runs.

The web tools support:

- Brave Search with an API key
- DuckDuckGo without an API key
- recoverable error outputs so the model can continue after soft web failures

## Specs And Contracts

The current source-of-truth docs are:

- `agen-spec-v1.4.md` for product behavior and scope
- `agen-contracts-v1.4.md` for TypeScript interfaces, event types, and schema boundaries
- `agen-runtime-v1.4-algorithms.md` for execution and delegation behavior notes

Historical and transition docs are also checked in for comparison:

- `agen-spec-v1.md`
- `agen-spec-v1.3.md`
- `agen-contracts-v1.3.md`
- `agen-contracts-v1.4-multi-agent.md`

If code and docs disagree, treat the v1.4 spec and contract docs as the intended design, and treat the current implementation as the executable prototype that is still catching up.

## Development

Build the core package:

```bash
cd packages/core
bun run build
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
cd packages/core
bun test
```

The root workspace is mostly a container for docs, examples, and the `packages/core` prototype. Most implementation work happens inside `packages/core/src`.
